# Post-Comparison Output Program — Start Here

Workflow state: **Stage 1A complete; Stage 1B is next**

Last updated: 2026-07-26

This is the entry point for every new Codex or Claude chat. Read this file
before opening the other audit documents. The project deliberately separates
independent observation, cross-checking, planning, implementation, and
approval so that one agent's conclusions do not contaminate another agent's
first pass.

## Next action

Run
[`prompts/PROMPT-01-CLAUDE-INDEPENDENT-AUDIT.md`](prompts/PROMPT-01-CLAUDE-INDEPENDENT-AUDIT.md)
in a new Claude chat.

Claude must complete and freeze its independent round before reading Codex's
findings or the reconciliation documents.

## Workflow

| Stage | Purpose | Current status | Controlling prompt | Primary output |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1A | Codex independent deliverable audit | **COMPLETE** | Historical user request, normalized in `AUDIT-SCOPE-AND-PROVENANCE.md` | `MASTER-VERIFICATION.md`, `CODEX-FINDINGS.md` |
| 1B | Claude independent deliverable audit | **NEXT / NOT STARTED** | `prompts/PROMPT-01-CLAUDE-INDEPENDENT-AUDIT.md` | `CLAUDE-FINDINGS.md` |
| 2 | Codex/Claude cross-check and canonical findings | **BLOCKED on Stage 1B** | `prompts/PROMPT-02-CROSSCHECK-AND-FINAL-FINDINGS.md` | `FINAL-RECONCILIATION.md`, `FINAL-FINDINGS-FOR-IMPLEMENTATION.md` |
| 3 | Agree on ordered implementation bundles | **BLOCKED on Stage 2** | `prompts/PROMPT-03-AGREE-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md` | `IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md` |
| 4 | Implement one bounded hotfix bundle | **LOOP after Stage 3** | `prompts/PROMPT-04-IMPLEMENT-HOTFIX-BUNDLE.md` | Hotfix branch plus `hotfix-bundles/<ID>/IMPLEMENTATION.md` |
| 5 | Adversarially review and approve that bundle | **LOOP after each Stage 4** | `prompts/PROMPT-05-ADVERSARIAL-REVIEW-HOTFIX.md` | `hotfix-bundles/<ID>/REVIEW.md`; merge or return to Stage 4 |

Stages 4 and 5 repeat until every accepted implementation bundle is merged.
Each new bundle starts from the latest clean `main`.

## Independence firewall

Before Claude freezes Stage 1B, it may read only:

- this file;
- `AUDIT-SCOPE-AND-PROVENANCE.md`;
- `CLAUDE-FINDINGS.md`;
- `prompts/PROMPT-01-CLAUDE-INDEPENDENT-AUDIT.md`;
- application code and the frozen raw inputs named in the scope document.

Before that freeze, Claude must not read:

- `MASTER-VERIFICATION.md`;
- `CODEX-FINDINGS.md`;
- `FINAL-RECONCILIATION.md`;
- `FINAL-FINDINGS-FOR-IMPLEMENTATION.md`;
- Codex-generated comparisons, contact sheets, source-audit ledgers, or the
  retained `handoff-docs` folder.

The firewall ends only after Claude has marked its own matrix and findings
`CLAUDE ROUND 1 COMPLETE`, committed them, and recorded the commit SHA.

## Document authority

| File | Workflow role |
|---|---|
| `AUDIT-SCOPE-AND-PROVENANCE.md` | Neutral scope, frozen sources, comparison topology, and audit rules |
| `MASTER-VERIFICATION.md` | Closed Stage 1A Codex matrix; not joint truth |
| `CODEX-FINDINGS.md` | Closed Stage 1A Codex findings |
| `CLAUDE-FINDINGS.md` | Stage 1B independent Claude workspace |
| `FINAL-RECONCILIATION.md` | Stage 2 decision-by-decision conflict resolution |
| `FINAL-FINDINGS-FOR-IMPLEMENTATION.md` | Stage 2 canonical, deduplicated findings |
| `IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md` | Stage 3 approved bundle queue and acceptance contracts |
| `hotfix-bundles/<ID>/` | Stage 4 implementation log and Stage 5 review record for one bundle |

No finding is implementation authority until it appears in
`FINAL-FINDINGS-FOR-IMPLEMENTATION.md`. No code change is authorized until its
bundle appears as `READY` in `IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md`.

## Branch and worktree policy

- Audit and planning branches contain documentation only.
- Every implementation bundle uses a new branch from the latest `main`, named
  `hotfix/<bundle-id>-<short-slug>`.
- Prefer a separate worktree for every hotfix so the user's normal checkout
  remains available.
- A hotfix branch contains only its agreed bundle. Do not opportunistically
  include another report family or shared cleanup.
- A denied review returns to Stage 4 on the same hotfix branch.
- A bundle merges to `main` only after its required independent approvals.
- After a verified merge, remove that bundle's worktree and fully merged
  hotfix branch. Preserve `gh-pages` and unrelated branches.
- The next bundle always branches from the newly updated `main`, never from a
  previous hotfix branch.

## Frozen artifact locations

- Repository:
  `C:\Users\Yunus\Projects\TSMIS-Reports-Exporter`
- Codex retained audit root:
  `C:\Users\Yunus\Downloads\TSMIS\_scratch\post-comparison-perfection-output-audit-2026-07-23`
- Codex generated comparisons:
  `<Codex retained audit root>\generated-comparisons`
- Codex handoff copy:
  `<Codex retained audit root>\handoff-docs`

These Codex artifacts become available to Claude only in Stage 2. Claude must
use a separate scratch/output root during Stage 1B.
