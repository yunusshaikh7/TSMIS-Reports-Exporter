This is the entry point for every new Codex or Claude chat. Read this file
before opening the other audit documents. The project deliberately separates
independent observation, cross-checking, planning, implementation, and
approval so that one agent's conclusions do not contaminate another agent's
first pass.

## Next action

Return RB-2 to the plan owner before another runtime edit, then resume
[`PROMPT-04-IMPLEMENT-HOTFIX-BUNDLE.md`](prompts/PROMPT-04-IMPLEMENT-HOTFIX-BUNDLE.md)
on the existing `hotfix/rb-2-deliverable-presentation` branch with
`<BUNDLE_ID> = RB-2` and `<IMPLEMENTER> = Claude` only after that ruling.

Codex Review 2 re-review closes `RB2-R2-EG-003`. The expanded witness now takes
its exact deliverable set from the same-head measure record and covers **60 of
60** head deliverables, 526 visible sheets, and 8,200 columns with **0** owned
materially clipped cells. The committed verifier re-derived the 418-file runtime
digest, bound all 21 claimed results and all five committed witnesses to
acceptance head `06266eca1a4858dc5ebd000d1dd2e946249c7338`, and reported zero
problems.

The re-review nevertheless denies one concrete frozen-scope failure as
`RB2-R2-004`. The accepted runtime calls `_fit_data_columns` on every data sheet
even though the signed HF-02 contract explicitly excludes the data columns and
requires their behaviour to remain unchanged. It also adds presentation geometry
to `write_source_files_sheet`, although the allowed `compare_tsn_common.py`
surface is provenance selection only. The implementation itself confirms both
changes and asks the reviewer to choose among scope policies. Prompt 05 does not
let a reviewer rewrite the signed plan; the exact denial is in
[`hotfix-bundles/RB-2/REVIEW.md`](hotfix-bundles/RB-2/REVIEW.md).

The plan owner must either authorize the existing presentation surfaces and
reconcile the contradictory scope text, or require them reverted. If runtime
changes, establish a new exact acceptance head and regenerate/rebind the whole
RB2-A1 set. Do not merge, clean up, or begin RB-3.

## Workflow

| Stage | Purpose | Current status | Controlling prompt | Primary output |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1A | Codex independent deliverable audit | **COMPLETE** | Historical user request, normalized in `AUDIT-SCOPE-AND-PROVENANCE.md` | `MASTER-VERIFICATION.md`, `CODEX-FINDINGS.md` |
| 1B | Claude independent deliverable audit | **COMPLETE** (freeze `c788b29`) | `prompts/PROMPT-01-CLAUDE-INDEPENDENT-AUDIT.md` | `CLAUDE-FINDINGS.md` |
| 2 | Codex/Claude cross-check and canonical findings | **COMPLETE — JOINTLY APPROVED** | `prompts/PROMPT-02-CROSSCHECK-AND-FINAL-FINDINGS.md` | `FINAL-RECONCILIATION.md`, `FINAL-FINDINGS-FOR-IMPLEMENTATION.md` |
| 3 | Agree on ordered implementation bundles | **COMPLETE — JOINTLY AGREED** | `prompts/PROMPT-03-AGREE-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md` | `IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md`, `hotfix-bundles/<RB-ID>/BUNDLE.md` |
| 4 | Implement one bounded RB bundle | **RB-2 DENIED — RETURN TO IMPLEMENTATION (`RB2-R2-004`; planning ruling required)** | `prompts/PROMPT-04-IMPLEMENT-HOTFIX-BUNDLE.md` | Hotfix branch plus `hotfix-bundles/<RB-ID>/IMPLEMENTATION.md` |
| 5 | Adversarially review and approve that bundle | **RB-2 REVIEW 2 RE-REVIEW DENIED** | `prompts/PROMPT-05-ADVERSARIAL-REVIEW-HOTFIX.md` | `hotfix-bundles/<RB-ID>/REVIEW.md`; merge or return to Stage 4 |

Stages 4 and 5 repeat until every accepted implementation bundle is merged.
Each new bundle starts from the latest clean `main`.

## Independence firewall — ENDED 2026-07-26

The firewall is spent. Claude froze Stage 1B at `c788b29` with a signed
independence declaration, so both rounds may now read everything. The section
below is retained as the record of what the rule was while it was in force.

Before Claude freezes Stage 1B, it may read only:

- this file;
- `AUDIT-SCOPE-AND-PROVENANCE.md`;
- `CLAUDE-FINDINGS.md`;
- `prompts/PROMPT-01-CLAUDE-INDEPENDENT-AUDIT.md`;
- application code and the frozen raw inputs named in the scope document.

Before that freeze, Claude must not read:

- `MASTER-VERIFICATION.md`;
- `CODEX-FINDINGS.md`;
- `FINAL-RECONCILIATION.md`;
- `FINAL-FINDINGS-FOR-IMPLEMENTATION.md`;
- Codex-generated comparisons, contact sheets, source-audit ledgers, or the
  retained `handoff-docs` folder.

The firewall ends only after Claude has marked its own matrix and findings
`CLAUDE ROUND 1 COMPLETE`, committed them, and recorded the commit SHA.

## Document authority

| File | Workflow role |
|---|---|
| `AUDIT-SCOPE-AND-PROVENANCE.md` | Neutral scope, frozen sources, comparison topology, and audit rules |
| `MASTER-VERIFICATION.md` | Closed Stage 1A Codex matrix; not joint truth |
| `CODEX-FINDINGS.md` | Closed Stage 1A Codex findings |
| `CLAUDE-FINDINGS.md` | Stage 1B independent Claude workspace |
| `FINAL-RECONCILIATION.md` | Stage 2 decision-by-decision conflict resolution |
| `FINAL-FINDINGS-FOR-IMPLEMENTATION.md` | Stage 2 canonical, deduplicated findings |
| `IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md` | Stage 3 approved bundle queue and acceptance contracts |
| `hotfix-bundles/<RB-ID>/` | Stage 4 contract/implementation log and Stage 5 review record for one implementation bundle |
| `hotfix-bundles/<HF-ID>/witness/` | Small committed witness for one work-item acceptance oracle |

No finding is implementation authority until it appears in
`FINAL-FINDINGS-FOR-IMPLEMENTATION.md`. No code change is authorized until its
owning **RB bundle** appears as `READY` in `IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md`.

## Branch and worktree policy

- Audit and planning branches contain documentation only.
- Every implementation bundle uses a new branch from the latest `main`, named
  `hotfix/<rb-id>-<short-slug>`.
- Prefer a separate worktree for every hotfix so the user's normal checkout
  remains available.
- A hotfix branch contains only its agreed bundle. Do not opportunistically
  include another report family or shared cleanup.
- A denied review returns to Stage 4 on the same hotfix branch.
- A bundle merges to `main` only after its required independent approvals.
- After a verified merge, remove that bundle's worktree and fully merged
  hotfix branch. Preserve `gh-pages` and unrelated branches.
- The next bundle always branches from the newly updated `main`, never from a
  previous hotfix branch.

## Frozen artifact locations

- Repository:
  `C:\Users\Yunus\Projects\TSMIS-Reports-Exporter`
- Codex retained audit root:
  `C:\Users\Yunus\Downloads\TSMIS\_scratch\post-comparison-perfection-output-audit-2026-07-23`
- Codex generated comparisons:
  `<Codex retained audit root>\generated-comparisons`
- Codex handoff copy:
  `<Codex retained audit root>\handoff-docs`
- Claude retained audit root (Stage 1B):
  `C:\Users\Yunus\Downloads\TSMIS\_scratch\post-comparison-output-audit-claude-independent-2026-07-23`
  — 2,336 files / 9,570,952,287 bytes, `witness\MANIFEST.json` carries path, size
  and sha256 for each
- Stage 2 neutral recheck root:
  `C:\Users\Yunus\Downloads\TSMIS\_scratch\post-comparison-output-audit-stage2-reconciliation`
  — `measure_clipping.py` plus `witness\clipping_recheck.json` and
  `witness\tsn_provenance_warning_scope.json`

These Codex artifacts became available to Claude only in Stage 2. Claude used a
separate scratch/output root during Stage 1B, and Stage 2 rechecks live in their
own neutral root so neither round's tooling is reused to settle a conflict.

Claude's Stage 1B round also copied the frozen archive and the retained batch
into `output\2026-07-23 ssor-prod`, `output\2026-07-09 ssor-prod` and
`output\2026-07-09 ars-prod` (git-ignored) because the By Day / Baseline /
PDF-vs-Excel matrices read run folders from `OUTPUT_ROOT`, and left By Day
outputs under `output\comparisons\`. They are technically disposable — the raw
archive and the ground-truth batch were never written to — but **RETAIN them
until the Stage 3 plan's definition of done is met**: they are the by-day /
Baseline / PDF-vs-Excel acceptance inputs for every hotfix bundle, and deleting
them also removes the inputs for re-running Stage 2's RC-3 probe. (This
supersedes the earlier "safe to delete" note.)
