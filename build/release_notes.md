Portable Windows desktop app that bulk-exports Caltrans TSMIS reports for every
California state route — sign in once, tick the reports you want, done (see
`Start Here.txt` inside the zip).

## Pick your download

| Download | Best for | Browser it uses |
|---|---|---|
| `…-win64.zip` | Most users — smallest download | The Microsoft Edge / Google Chrome already installed on the PC |
| `…-win64-with-browser.zip` | Managed PCs where Edge sign-in misbehaves and Chrome isn't installed | Ships its own **Built-in Chromium** and uses it by default; Edge and Chrome stay in the header dropdown |
| `…-batch-source.zip` | Developers / console fallback | Requires Python 3.11 — `1. setup (one time).bat` installs the libraries **and downloads Chromium** |

Both app zips: unzip anywhere writable and double-click `TSMIS Exporter.exe`.

## Highlights

- **Sign-in works on the new TSMIS site (0.7.4).** Root cause finally pinned
  by field diagnostics: the portal sign-in page shows its "Caltrans Azure AD"
  button before the button's click handler is wired up, so the tool's early
  click landed dead and nothing happened. The tool now keeps clicking each
  second until the page actually moves, and after several dead clicks drives
  the sign-in hop directly via the portal's own SAML URL. The headed Edge
  sign-in window also pre-grants the local-network permission (its prompt
  used to open as an extra tab).
- **Pick the data source and environment.** Two new header dropdowns choose
  **SSOR or ARS** and **Prod / Test / Dev** (defaults: SSOR + Prod) — the tool
  now drives the new TSMIS site, one page for every combination. Console flow:
  set `TSMIS_SRC` / `TSMIS_ENV`.
- **Each day's exports get their own folder.** Files now land in
  `output\<YYYY-MM-DD>\<report>\`, so tomorrow's run starts fresh instead of
  skipping over today's files. The Consolidate tab gained an **Export day**
  picker (newest first, newest by default; console prompts, Enter = newest),
  and the combined workbook is saved in that day's `consolidated\` folder.
  Exports made with older versions are still found when no dated folders exist.
- **Fast mode is greyed out without a saved login**, with an explanation:
  automatic Edge sign-in runs one browser at a time (the sign-in profile can't
  be shared), so parallel runs need a saved session (e.g. sign in with Chrome).
- **Fits small screens.** The window now caps its height to the screen and can
  be shrunk — the log pane absorbs the difference instead of the bottom
  buttons being cut off.
- **Hands-free sign-in on managed Caltrans PCs** (since v0.6): after one normal
  Edge sign-in, login and exports sign themselves in automatically — no
  password, no window. Chrome stays on the manual sign-in path.
- First run: if Windows warns about an unknown publisher, choose
  "More info" → "Run anyway" (in-house unsigned tool). If downloaded as a zip,
  right-click → Properties → Unblock before extracting.
