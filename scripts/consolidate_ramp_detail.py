"""Consolidate TSAR: Ramp Detail XLSX files into a single workbook.

Reads every XLSX in   output/ramp_detail/
Writes one workbook in output/consolidated/tsar_ramp_detail_consolidated.xlsx
with a leading "Route" column added so rows from different routes are
distinguishable in the combined file.

Thin wrapper over consolidate_xlsx_base, which is shared with Highway Sequence
and Highway Log -- all three are "one sheet, header row + data rows" exports that
differ only by input folder, sheet name, and output name. (The Ramp Summary
consolidator stays standalone because it parses PDFs, not XLSX.)

Importable (Phase 3b): consolidate(events, confirm_overwrite) returns a
ConsolidateResult and never prints/prompts/exits, so the GUI can drive it. The
console UX lives in cli.run_consolidate_cli, used by the __main__ entry (and
therefore by "4. consolidate (combine reports).bat").
