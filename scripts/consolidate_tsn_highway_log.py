"""Convert TSN district Highway Log PDFs into TSMIS-format Excel and combine.

Ported from the TSMIS-Report-Consolidator sibling project (the PDF parsing
core is verbatim — it is calibrated against real district PDFs); only the
consolidate() interface is adapted to this app's registry contract.

Reads every district PDF in  input/tsn_highway_log/   (e.g. D01_Highway_Log_TSN.pdf)
Writes per-route workbooks in output/tsn_highway_log/  (tsn_highway_log_d01_route_001.xlsx)
and one combined workbook   output/tsn_highway_log_consolidated.xlsx

Unlike the TSMIS consolidators, the inputs are NOT this app's dated exports:
TSN PDFs are vendor snapshots the user drops into the input folder, so the
"Export day" concept doesn't apply (the `day` parameter is accepted for
interface compatibility and ignored). The per-route conversions this run
writes are exactly what the Highway Log comparison takes as its TSN file.

The TSN (Transportation System Network) "California State Highway Log"
(report OTM52010) is a fixed-layout PDF listing: a 3-line column-header band
per page, a centered "<district> <county> <route>" group header, one data line
per highway segment (sometimes wrapping onto a second baseline), description
lines *below* the segment they belong to, and "* * Volume Location Totals"
summary lines.

Each per-route output uses the SAME sheet name ("Highway Log") and the SAME 31
columns as the per-route TSMIS Highway Log export, so:
  * the shared XLSX consolidator combines them unchanged (Route prepended from
    the filename), and
  * the combined workbook lines up column-for-column with the consolidated
    TSMIS Highway Log for comparison.
TSN-only data that has no TSMIS column (the ADT traffic figures) is dropped;
TSN description lines are joined into the TSMIS "Description" column.

Parsing is x-position based (the PDF is proportional Helvetica, not
monospaced): every data CHARACTER is assigned to a column by the horizontal
window its center falls in -- word-level parsing is not safe here, because
adjacent columns can print closer together than word-segmentation tolerances
(a filled City code starts ~2pt after the county odometer, fusing into one
token like '042.010LKPT'). The windows are calibrated to the OTM52010 layout
and verified stable across every data row of the sample districts.

Console-free like the other consolidators: progress via events.on_log,
overwrite confirmed through the callback, cancel honored between pages, and a
ConsolidateResult returned. The console UX lives in cli.run_consolidate_cli.
